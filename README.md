A small-scale, two-player game.

> **Oops, a critical malfunction detected.**

- Warp engine ignition failed...  
- Steering assistance offline...  
- Braking system down...  
- Energy shield severely damaged...  
- …………  

> **Power spike reboot successful.**  
> **Radar array coming online.**

Well, take note—while our **power spike** is incredibly tough, nearly indestructible, our **main body is extremely fragile** without the energy shield. Fortunately, it seems our opponent is facing the same issue. Perhaps we can use our spike to crash into their main body and destroy them…

## 🎮 Game Modes

The game features two modes: **Timed Mode** and **Pure Mode**.

### ⏱ Timed Mode

Players can set a match duration. Within the time limit, both players must collect as many **energy orbs** as possible to earn points.  
Destroying the opponent grants extra points, but they will **respawn after a short delay**.  
The winner is determined by the **final score**.

### ⚔️ Pure Mode

There is **no time limit**, and **no energy orbs** spawn on the map.  
The only goal is to **destroy the opponent in a head-to-head battle**.
